# Master's Thesis Code Documentation

This repository documents all of the code produced for [my Master's thesis](https://github.com/gussmith23/masters-thesis/releases/), completed in Spring 2018 at Penn State. It assumes you have a basic understanding of the _content_ of my thesis. If you do not, then please start by skimming over my thesis.

This repository should be used for:
- getting the code set up on your machine (installing dependencies, building the code, running the code)
- getting acquainted with the structure of the code
- understanding future development directions

## How to Use This Document
First, skim my thesis. Again, this document assumes you have a high-level understanding of my thesis. Then, read through the overview of projects.

## Overview of Projects

The repositories associated with my thesis are:
- *[llvm-pim-passes.]()* LLVM analysis passes for detecting PIM patterns.
- *[masters-thesis-data-generation.]()* Tools for running LLVM analysis passes over benchmarks and generating results.
- *[gussmith23/test-suite.]()* My fork of LLVM's test-suite project, with modifications for compiling "monolithic" LLVM IR files.
- *[gussmith23/gem5.]()* My fork of gem5, with modifications for decoding PIM instructions.
- *[gussmith23/dg.]()* My fork of mchalupa's dg project, with miscellaneous fixes.
- *[masters-thesis.]()* LaTeX code for my master's thesis paper, thesis defense presentation, and 3-slide summary of my thesis. It might be useful if you are looking for LaTeX figures describing my work.
